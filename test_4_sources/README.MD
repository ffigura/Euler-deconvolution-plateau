This repository contains a collection of Python codes and synthetic data 
example for a paper about the open-source package Euler deconvolution.The 
example data reproduce the synthetc results and figures shown in the publication.
The Euler deconvolution package `euler_python.py` is compatible with Python 2.7
and 3.7 programming language. To run the program,the numpy library is required. 
In addition, numpy is to run the complementary codes for the tests `estimates_statistics.py`
and the matplotlib is required to run the scripts `plot_functions.py` and `synthetic_test.py`.

1 - Abstract
----------------------
In most applications, the Euler deconvolution aims to define the nature (type) of the geologic source (i.e., the structural index [SI]) and its depth position. However, Euler deconvolution also estimates the horizontal positions of the sources and the base level of the magnetic anomaly. To determine the correct SI, most authors take advantage of the clustering of depth estimates. We have analyzed Euler’s equation to indicate that random variables contaminating the magnetic observations and its gradients affect the base-level estimates if, and only if, the SI is not assumed correctly. Grounded on this theoretical analysis and assuming a set of tentative SIs, we have developed a new criterion for determining the correct SI by means of the minimum standard deviation of base-level estimates. We performed synthetic tests simulating multiple magnetic sources with different SIs. To produce mid and strongly interfering synthetic magnetic anomalies, we added constant and nonlinear backgrounds to the anomalies and approximated the simulated sources laterally. If the magnetic anomalies are weakly interfering, the minima standard deviations either of the depth or base-level estimates can be used to determine the correct SI. However, if the magnetic anomalies are strongly interfering, only the minimum standard deviation of the base-level estimates can determine the SI correctly. These tests also show that Euler deconvolution does not require that the magnetic data be corrected for the regional fields (e.g., International Geomagnetic Reference Field [IGRF]). Tests on real data from part of the Goiás Alkaline Province, Brazil, confirm the potential of the minimum standard deviation of base-level estimates in determining the SIs of the sources by applying Euler deconvolution either to total-field measurements or to total-field anomaly (corrected for IGRF). Our result suggests three plug intrusions giving rise to the Diorama anomaly and dipole-like sources yielding Arenópolis and Montes Claros de Goiás anomalies.

2 - Content
----------------------

A synthetic test can be reproduced with these codes, the test can be reproduced from the folder
`test_4_sources`.

Python codes:

	- euler_python.py
		General Python module containing the functions to compute de derivatives and Euler deconvolution.
	
	- synthetic_test.py
		Python script to generate the synthetic results. The script loads the total-field
		anomaly of a synthetic model from the file "synthetic_data.dat" and computes the
		Euler deconvolution using the functions in "euler_python.py". The results are 
		generated using the functions "plot_functions.py" for the plots and 
		"estimates_statistics.py" to compute the statistics of the data. 
		
	- plot_functions.py:
		Python script to generate the figures in the synthetic tests results. 
	
	- estimates_statistics.py:
		Python script to compute the mean of the northing, easting and depth estimates.  
	
Outputs: 
 
	- figures - all figures that generated the synthetic example in the manuscript will be saved
			in this folder. The figures generated may differ from the publication and
			can be adapted in the script `plot_functions.py`.
						 
	- results - the standard deviations of depth and base-level estimates, the mean of the northing, easting and depth estimates over the selected areas.

Test data:

	- input/synthetic_data.dat
		Synthetic magnetic data generated using the Python packaged "Fatiando a Terra":	
		http://fatiando.org/. This data is an example used in the current publication.
	
3 - Prerequisites
----------------------
The Python program Euler deconvolution - `euler_python.py` and the scripts `estimates_statistics.py` requires 
the Python library "numpy" and the scripts `synthetic_test.py` and `plot_functions.py` requires the Python
packages "numpy" and "matplotlib". 
The easier way to get Python and all libraries installed is through the Anaconda Python 
distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). After installed Anaconda, install the libraries 
by running the following command in your terminal:

	conda install numpy matplotlib

The program for Euler deconvolution `euler_python.py` and the algorithm `synthetic_test.py`
 are compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.7.
 
4 - Parameterization
----------------------
There is one parameters of our methodology for Euler deconvolution that is the window size. 
The moving data window size is defined in the parameter `winsize`.

Additionally, the structural indices are defined in the array `SI_vet`, this array can receive as many SIs as desired.
The areas to compute the statistics about the mean of the northing, easting and depth estimates are defined in a polygon by the array `area_plt`.

5 - Running the files
----------------------
After Anaconda and the libraries are installed, you need to run 
the code `synthetic_test.py` to generate the results.
There are two easy ways to run the synthetic test `synthetic_test.py`

1. Via command line: 

	1.1 On linux based systems open the command prompt windows (terminal), and run the command:
	
	On Python 2.7: python synthetic_test.py 
	On Python 3.7: python3 synthetic_test.py 

	1.2 On windows based systems open the Iphyton console (Python 2.7) or 
	Anaconda Navigator and then Jupyter QtConsole (Python 3.7), and run the command:

	run synthetic_test.py

2. Open the Spyder program that comes with the Ananconda installation. In the Spyder, open
the example script "synthetic_test.py" and click in "play" inside the Spyder to execute it.

If everything runs ok, the figures and results shown in the publication will be saved, respectively,
on the folders: `/figures` and `/results`.

The  module `euler_python.py` can be imported to an interactive Python session or called from
an external Python module. The functionalities are documented using standard Python
docstrings.

The file `synthetic_test.py` is a Python-based command line script. By using this 
script, the figures and results of the synthetic test presented in the publication can be reproduced.
The figures generated may differ from the publication and can be adapted in the script `plot_functions.py`.
