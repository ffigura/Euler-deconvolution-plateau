# Correct structural index in Euler deconvolution via base-level estimates

by
Felipe F. Melo and Val√©ria C.F. Barbosa

## About

This paper was published in the journal *Geophysics*.

This repository contains the source code to perform a synthetic test. The codes `euler_python.py`, the synthetic data `synthetic_data.dat` presented in the paper and the codes `synthetic_test.py`, `estimates_statistics.py` and `plot_functions.py` to generate the results of the synthetic test.

The *euler_python* program is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.7 programming language.
 
## Abstract

TBD

## Content

- euler_python.py:
	General Python module containing the functions to compute de derivatives and 
	Euler deconvolution.
	
- synthetic_test.py:
	Python script to generate the synthetic results. The script loads the total-field
	anomaly of a synthetic model from the file "synthetic_data.dat" and computes the
	Euler deconvolution using the functions in "euler_python.py". The results are 
	generated using the functions "plot_functions.py" for the plots and 
	"estimates_statistics.py" to compute the statistics of the data.
	
- plot_functions.py:
	Python script to generate the figures in the synthetic tests results. 
	
- estimates_statistics.py:
	Python script to compute the mean of the northing, easting and depth estimates. 
	
Test data:

- synthetic_data.dat:
		Synthetic total-field anomaly data generated using the Python packaged
		"Fatiando a Terra": http://fatiando.org/. This data is an example used
		in the current publication.

## Getting the code

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ffigura/Euler-deconvolution-plateau.git

or [download a zip archive](https://github.com/ffigura/Euler-deconvolution-plateau/archive/master.zip).


## Dependencies

The Python program Euler deconvolution - "euler_python.py" requires the Python library "numpy", 
the scripts "synthetic_test.py" and "plot_functions.py" require the Python packages "numpy"
and "matplotlib", and the script "estimates_statistics.py" requires the Python package "numpy".
The easier way to get Python and all libraries installed is through the Anaconda Python 
distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). After installed Anaconda, install the libraries 
by running the following command in your terminal:

	conda install numpy matplotlib

The program for Euler deconvolution "euler_python.py" and the additional codes "synthetic_test.py",
"plot_functions.py" and "estimates_statistics.py" are compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.7.

## Reproducing the results

The results and figures for the synthetic test are reproducible from the folder `/test_4_sources`.
Running the code `synthetic_test.py` will allow the reprodution of the results. For more information
read the file `README.MD` or `README.txt` in the folder `/code`.
