# Synthetic test 1 â€“ Distinct SIs and linear magnetic base level

Running the code `synthetic_test.py` will allow the reprodution of the results.
The figures generated can be adapted in the script `plot_functions.py`.

## Input:

- input - synthetic_data.dat

## Parameters:

- Size of the moving data window:    
    winsize - an odd integer number. 
              Ex.: for a moving data window of 5 x 5 grid points -> winsize = 5
                                  
- Structural indices used:
    SI_vet - an array that can store any of the four SIs.
             Ex.: to test only the SI = 1 -> SI_vet = [1]
                  to test the four SIs -> SI_vet = [0.01,1,2,3]

- The areas to compute the standard devaition of the depth and base-level estimates and the mean of the northing, easting and depth estimates:
    area_plt  - array defining the four vertices of a polygon 
                [south,north,west,east]

## Outputs:

- figures - Figures 1, , 2, 3 and 4 will be saved
		in this folder. 
    
- results - the standard deviation of depth and base-level estimates and the mean of the northing, easting and depth estimates over the selected areas.
